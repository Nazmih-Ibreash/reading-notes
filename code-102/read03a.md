 # Structure Web Pages With HTML 
 <br/>
 
 ## HTML & CSS Structure
 <br/>

 * HTML pages are text documents
 * HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
    brackets) to give the information they surround special
    meaning.
 * Tags are referred to as elements, they are usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
    the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
 * Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
    about the content of that element.
 * Attributes require a name and a value.


 ## HTML5 Layout



* The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
    different parts of a web page and help to describe
    its structure.
* The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple \<div\> elements).
* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.


## Extra Markup

* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
* You can add comments to your code between the \<!-- and --\> markers.
* The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
* The \<div\> and \<span\> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
* \<iframes\> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
* The \<meta\> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
* Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.
