 * HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
    brackets) to give the information they surround special
    meaning.
 * Tags are referred to as elements, they are usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes

 * Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
    about the content of that element.
 * Attributes require a name and a value.
