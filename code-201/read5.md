# HTML Images; CSS Color & Text

**We use images in html for many purposes, like to make a web page more attractive and interesting instead of being boring with full text.**

> \<img src= \"\"    alt=\"\"  title=\"\" \>

so we can use img element to insert images into our web pages.
there are three main attributes:
  1. `src` for the direction of image
  2. `alt` to describe the in case of the link is breaked
  3. `title` it helps people with visual impairments

* three rules for creating images:
    1. save image in right format
    2. save image at right size
    3. use the correct resolution
